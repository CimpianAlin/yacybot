The YaCy IRC Bot
================

This is a little IRC bot written in Python which can search a YaCy peer and
output the results to a IRC channel.

Additional requirements
-----------------------

The script depends on two libraries that are not included in python and have to
be installed separately:

- The Python IRC library (http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/). You need at
  least irclib.py and ircbot.py. Only version 0.4.8 was tested.

- html2text (http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/html2text/). Commit ID
  c368b1491c2829b5c48c384c3316edcab43778b6 was tested.

Configuration
-------------

All configuration variables for the bot are in config.py. Just edit them as you
like.
